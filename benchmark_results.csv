Qwen-0.5B (qlora) - Base Model (Untuned),melon crunch parfait,6.97,6,"The recipe attempts to make a melon crunch parfait but lacks detail and clarity in some areas. It misses key components like specific types of melons, quantities for ingredients, and precise steps for the topping layer. While it follows a general structure of a parfait base, a more detailed explanation would significantly improve the recipe's accuracy.",1648,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (qlora) - Qlora Fine-Tuned,melon crunch parfait,11.96,6,"The recipe attempts to assemble a melon crunch parfait but falls short in several areas. It lacks specific instructions for the 'crunch' aspect (like crushed nuts or granola). The use of blueberries and chocolate pudding feels arbitrary, as these flavors clash rather than complementing typical melon flavors. While the overall concept is valid, the lack of detail and clarity hinders a higher score.",1542,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (qlora) - Base Model (Untuned),barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon,6.66,6,"The recipe successfully identifies the desired ingredients (ground beef, bacon, beans) and outlines a basic cooking process.

Qwen-0.5B (qlora) - Base Model (Untuned),crustless asparagus quiche,6.62,6,"The recipe attempts to provide a basic outline for a crustless asparagus quiche, but lacks the depth and detail of a properly-structured dish description.

Qwen-0.5B (qlora) - Base Model (Untuned),my mom s rice pudding,6.72,6,"The recipe successfully outlines the main components of a rice pudding, however it presents a level of complexity and lacks detail that might be expected from a more sophisticated model. It's a good starting point for a basic recipe, but needs further refinement before being considered truly representative of a specific 'mom's Rice Pudding'. For example:  The quantity of spices and the use of ingredients like cream of golla are not typically used in a traditional rice pudding.",1389,gemma2:2b

Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Base Model (Untuned),melon crunch parfait,6.84,2,"The recipe is remarkably unfocused. It lists a plethora of ingredients in the same quantities with no indication of how they're to be assembled or blended into a coherent parfait structure.  While it uses some commonly-accepted components, the overwhelming repetition of the word 'blueberry' and lack of clear instructions suggests the model lacks understanding of a recipe's core concept.",1185,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Prompt_Tuning Fine-Tuned,melon crunch parfait,1.48,3,"The recipe doesn't seem to understand the concept of a 'melon crunch parfait.'

It accurately describes the main components (asparagus, eggs), baking instructions, and the use of cheese for topping. However, there's room for improvement in terms of detail and complexity.  For example, the instruction to 'use your choice of cheese' could benefit from some suggestions for types, perhaps even mentioning different cheese styles (aged vs. fresh). The lack of detailed steps like cooking the asparagus or measuring ingredients could be improved.",1609,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Prompt_Tuning Fine-Tuned,crustless asparagus quiche,1.88,6,"The recipe attempts to create a crustless asparagus quiche, but the instructions are overly simplistic and lack clear steps.
