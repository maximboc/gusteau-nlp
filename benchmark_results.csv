Qwen-0.5B (Recipe Tuned) - Base Model (Untuned),melon crunch parfait,21.06,1,"This recipe is a catastrophic failure on all criteria. It entirely misses the 'melon' from 'Melon Crunch Parfait'. The instructions are illogical and unsafe, notably the inclusion of 1/2 cup of vanilla extract which is an absurd and unpalatable quantity for any dish, let alone a small parfait, and the instruction to serve it 'warm and creamy' after being submerged in ice water, contradicting the very nature of a parfait. The 'filling' described is not a standard parfait component, and there's no clear 'crunch' element. This represents severe hallucinations in both ingredients and culinary process.",1852,gemini-2.5-flash
Qwen-0.5B (Recipe Tuned) - LoRA Fine-Tuned,melon crunch parfait,13.47,7,"The recipe generates a basic outline for a melon crunch parfait.  However, the instructions are quite simple and lack detail on crucial elements like layering or precise amounts of ingredients. This is likely due to the model's limited parameter count.",1879,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (Recipe Tuned) - Base Model (Untuned),barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon,12.86,7,"The recipe successfully captures the essence of 'barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon.' It adheres to typical BBQ bean preparations by utilizing a base of ground meat and bell pepper. While lacking in culinary finesse, it provides a workable, if not particularly imaginative, approach to the requested dish. The instructions are clear and safe. However, some areas could benefit from elaboration or specific ingredient guidance for those seeking more complexity.",1620,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (Recipe Tuned) - LoRA Fine-Tuned,barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon,13.16,7,"The recipe largely hits the mark for a classic BBQ bean dish with ground beef and bacon. The instructions are generally clear, though some minor improvements could be made to enhance safety and clarity.  It does have a basic structure, but lacks in detail regarding specific cooking techniques or levels of preparation (i.e., shredding the beef without specifying the type of beef). It also doesn't mention a sauce, which is a standard component for barbecue beans.",1809,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (Recipe Tuned) - Base Model (Untuned),crustless asparagus quiche,13.82,7,"The recipe demonstrates a basic understanding of the ingredients and cooking process required for a crustless asparagus quiche. However, it lacks details in specific instructions like temperature control or proper timing for baking the asparagus.  It also doesn't provide clear information on how to assemble the filling itself before adding the ingredients into the pie-like bowl.",1317,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (Recipe Tuned) - LoRA Fine-Tuned,crustless asparagus quiche,13.98,6,"The recipe generally captures the essence of a crustless asparagus quiche. However, it lacks specific details on achieving a 'crustless' presentation and leaves out crucial components like cheese or cream for texture and savory depth. It also uses very vague wording like 'blend well' which could be misconstrued. The inclusion of instructions for a crust-based recipe without specifying how to create the 'crustless' version is confusing.",1676,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (Recipe Tuned) - Base Model (Untuned),my mom s rice pudding,13.74,6,"The recipe captures the basic elements of rice pudding, including ingredients and steps.  However, it lacks a certain depth in description or culinary detail. It would benefit from more personalized instructions, tips for achieving different consistencies, and perhaps a mention of cultural variations.",1649,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (Recipe Tuned) - LoRA Fine-Tuned,my mom s rice pudding,14.69,6,"The recipe vaguely resembles rice pudding but lacks clear steps for creating the custard base. It primarily focuses on incorporating oats and raisins into a slightly sweet pudding, which doesn't quite resemble traditional rice pudding methods. The model exhibits some understanding of ingredients like milk, eggs, and brown sugar, but the process needs further elaboration.",1788,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (Recipe Tuned) - Base Model (Untuned),elegant stuffed mushrooms,11.68,6,"The recipe demonstrates a basic understanding of the concept of stuffed mushrooms but lacks some sophistication. It follows a clear structure and utilizes standard ingredients. While it is technically correct, it could benefit from more detail in seasoning, suggested variations (e.g., using different cheese types), or even exploring alternative cooking methods like a breadcrumb crust. The 'elegant' aspect is subjective, so the score reflects its technical correctness but not originality.",1704,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (Recipe Tuned) - LoRA Fine-Tuned,elegant stuffed mushrooms,13.4,6,"The recipe attempts to create a 'elegant stuffed mushrooms' concept but lacks some nuance. While the ingredients list is generally sound for a traditional stuffed mushroom approach, the instructions are overly basic and lack detail about stuffing techniques, cooking times and even ingredient quantities needed. The use of various cheeses and nuts suggests creativity, but needs more structure.",1450,gemma2:2b
