Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Base Model (Untuned),melon crunch parfait,6.54,1,"The recipe fundamentally fails to deliver a 'melon crunch parfait' as it contains no melon whatsoever. Additionally, 100g of vanilla extract is an absurd and inedible quantity, indicating a severe hallucination regarding ingredient proportions. The instructions blend all ingredients, which contradicts the layered nature of a parfait and would eliminate any 'crunch' from the almonds. The tags are also highly repetitive and irrelevant to the dish name.",1360,gemini-2.5-flash
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - LoRA Fine-Tuned,melon crunch parfait,2.07,1,"The recipe completely fails to create a 'melon crunch parfait'. It contains no melon, no 'crunch' element, and the liquid proportions (0.36L water, 0.36L milk for 0.5 cup yogurt) would result in a thin beverage, not a parfait. The instructions are also illogical and confusing, attempting to combine ingredients in both a blender and a bowl simultaneously.",481,gemini-2.5-flash
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Base Model (Untuned),barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon,6.46,1,"The recipe fundamentally fails to deliver 'barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon.' It contains no beans, no bacon, and no barbecue sauce or related flavors. Instead, it lists 8 cups of cooked brown rice, shredded hot sausage, pepperoni, and mozzarella cheese, suggesting a completely different dish. Furthermore, the spice list exhibits severe repetition, indicating a loop or hallucination issue. Crucially, no instructions were provided, which was a specific request in the prompt.",1111,gemini-2.5-flash
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - LoRA Fine-Tuned,barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon,2.03,2,"The model completely failed to generate a recipe for 'barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon'. It critically omits beans and bacon from both the ingredients and instructions. The resulting dish would be a simple ground beef and vegetable mix with hot sauce, bearing no resemblance to the requested title. Additionally, the instructions hallucinate 'peppers' which are not listed in the ingredients.",524,gemini-2.5-flash
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Base Model (Untuned),crustless asparagus quiche,6.46,1,"This recipe fundamentally fails to create a quiche. The most crucial ingredient, eggs, is completely absent. It also contains several extreme hallucinations and inappropriate ingredients, such as 'croutons (chicken breast or turkey meatballs)', fresh mint, and capers, which have no place in a standard asparagus quiche. Many spices and herbs are also listed multiple times unnecessarily. The instructions are truncated, but the ingredient list alone is a catastrophic failure for the stated recipe.",1424,gemini-2.5-flash
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - LoRA Fine-Tuned,crustless asparagus quiche,1.95,2,"The recipe fundamentally fails to create a 'crustless asparagus quiche'. It omits essential dairy (milk/cream) for the egg custard and incorrectly instructs making a flour-butter paste (roux) as a base, then 'sprinkling in the egg mixture' without defining it. The main fillings (asparagus, onion, garlic) are listed but never integrated into the instructions. The 'formula of 0' is nonsensical. The method described would not result in a quiche.",486,gemini-2.5-flash
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Base Model (Untuned),my mom s rice pudding,6.46,1,"The recipe fundamentally fails to make 'rice pudding' as it entirely omits rice and instructs the use of flour instead, a critical hallucination. The instructions include illogical, repetitive steps (pouring and covering jars twice) and a potentially unsafe step (baking jars with tight lids, which can build pressure). The suggested baking time of 5-6 minutes is completely unrealistic for any baked pudding. Additionally, the ingredient list is not standard for a basic rice pudding, including yogurt and an excessive amount of add-ins, and misinterprets the request for 'pre-made vanilla and almond butter'.",1453,gemini-2.5-flash
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - LoRA Fine-Tuned,my mom s rice pudding,2.85,1,"This recipe fundamentally fails to make 'rice pudding' as it entirely omits rice from the ingredients list. Furthermore, it includes numerous non-standard ingredients like a large amount of butter, flour, baking powder, ice cream, and vegetable oil, which are completely inappropriate for traditional rice pudding. The instructions are illogical, suggesting a 'mix and chill' method for a dish that is typically cooked, and the specified container size is far too small for the ingredient quantities. This is a complete hallucination of a recipe.",635,gemini-2.5-flash
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Base Model (Untuned),elegant stuffed mushrooms,6.51,1,"This recipe completely misunderstands the concept of 'stuffed mushrooms'. It calls for sliced mushrooms instead of whole caps, includes large amounts of milk and sugar, and instructs the user to combine ingredients into a 'dough' which is then 'rolled into a ball' and 'poured onto a pan' like a pancake or fritter. This is not only illogical and contradictory ('dough' that can be 'poured'), but it fails to produce stuffed mushrooms entirely. The instructions are confusing, repetitive (adding sugar twice), and the storage advice for dairy products is unsafe ('Store them at room temperature for the first day'). This is a severe hallucination of the dish.",1710,gemini-2.5-flash
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - LoRA Fine-Tuned,elegant stuffed mushrooms,4.62,1,"This recipe fundamentally fails to create 'stuffed mushrooms' as it never includes a step to stuff the mushroom caps. It contains a clear hallucination ('onion cloves'), highly illogical and repetitive cooking instructions with conflicting times, and a potentially unsafe step (boiling olive oil). The overall process is incoherent and does not result in the advertised dish.",1286,gemini-2.5-flash
