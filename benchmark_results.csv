Qwen-0.5B (qlora) - Qlora Fine-Tuned,melon crunch parfait,8.41,6,"The recipe provides a starting point for a melon crunch parfait but lacks the depth and detail expected from a proper culinary guide. While it captures the essence of ingredients needed (melon, avocado, banana, etc.), the instructions are straightforward and don't offer guidance on methods or techniques (blending, layering, texture adjustments). It needs more elaboration to be considered truly accurate and functional.",836,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (qlora) - Base Model (Untuned),barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon,6.62,7,"The recipe successfully creates a basic 'barbecue beans' profile using ground beef, turkey, and kidney beans. However, the recipe lacks specific guidance on achieving that desired barbecue flavor profile (e.g., adding BBQ sauce) and relies heavily on repetitive instructions for seasoning. It also uses a surprising amount of hot sauce, which may not be suitable for everyone's taste.",1523,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (qlora) - Qlora Fine-Tuned,barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon,8.46,6,"The recipe attempts to capture the essence of barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon. However, it lacks some specific details that might elevate the dish's complexity or flavor profile, like a sauce base or seasoning techniques beyond basic salt and pepper. The instructions are largely logical and safe, but could benefit from clearer instructions on cooking methods, especially regarding the 'saute' step.",1772,gemma2:2b

Qwen-0.5B (qlora) - Qlora Fine-Tuned,crustless asparagus quiche,8.44,6,"The model attempts to capture the essence of a quiche but lacks precision in ingredient selection. While some ingredients are appropriate (asparagus, quince), others seem arbitrary and don't adhere to traditional quiche recipes.  The instructions are generally logical but lack depth, and there's no guidance on baking times or temperatures.",1464,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (qlora) - Base Model (Untuned),my mom s rice pudding,6.65,6,"The recipe attempts to capture the essence of 'my mom's rice pudding,' but its sheer length and reliance on a wide range of spices and ingredients suggests it might be overly complicated for a home cook. The lack of clear sequence/order in the list makes it difficult to understand exactly how to prepare the dish.  While some elements are common (milk, sugar), many specific spices are unusual in this context (like safflower, fava bean, or elderberry). This is likely due to the model's limited ability to grasp nuanced ingredient combinations and cultural specificity.",1152,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (qlora) - Qlora Fine-Tuned,my mom s rice pudding,8.48,6,"The recipe demonstrates a basic understanding of rice pudding's core components and instructions. However, the inclusion of excessive detailed instructions about chilling or freezing before serving and mentioning ice water multiple times might be seen as unnecessary for a simpler, more direct approach.",1810,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (qlora) - Base Model (Untuned),elegant stuffed mushrooms,6.62,6,"The recipe provides a basic outline of ingredients and suggests a filling. However, the sheer number of pepper types, and lack of clarification on cooking process, makes it difficult to understand how to actually execute this idea into a real meal. It needs to be more detailed.",1244,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (qlora) - Qlora Fine-Tuned,elegant stuffed mushrooms,8.43,6,"The recipe uses standard ingredients for stuffed mushrooms, but it lacks depth in terms of creativity and elaboration.  While the instructions are technically sound, they could benefit from more detailed steps and clearer language. For example, the ingredient list is very long and doesn't seem to be formatted efficiently.",1097,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Base Model (Untuned),melon crunch parfait,6.84,2,"The recipe is remarkably unfocused. It lists a plethora of ingredients in the same quantities with no indication of how they're to be assembled or blended into a coherent parfait structure.  While it uses some commonly-accepted components, the overwhelming repetition of the word 'blueberry' and lack of clear instructions suggests the model lacks understanding of a recipe's core concept.",1185,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Prompt_Tuning Fine-Tuned,melon crunch parfait,1.48,3,"The recipe doesn't seem to understand the concept of a 'melon crunch parfait.' It uses ingredients commonly found in sauces (lemon juice, sugar, olive oil) but fails to mention anything about melon or even the traditional components of a parfait. While it attempts to create a sauce-like base, it lacks crucial steps for achieving a desired result.",387,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Base Model (Untuned),barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon,6.48,6,"The recipe mostly captures the essence of barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon. However, the instructions are overly repetitive and lack clarity in some steps. Some ingredients like 'chili powder' appear to be added multiple times which could be streamlined. Also, the presence of guava in such a dish is unusual.",1046,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Prompt_Tuning Fine-Tuned,barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon,1.74,7,"The recipe captures the core elements of 'barbecue beans with ground beef and bacon', though it lacks detail and complexity. The instructions are largely logical and safe (except perhaps for using cornmeal and cornstarch as thickeners without clarification). It's a solid foundation for a basic version of the dish but could benefit from more detailed instructions and potential ingredient substitutions/adjustments.",460,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Base Model (Untuned),crustless asparagus quiche,6.48,7,"The recipe essentially follows the core principles of a crustless asparagus quiche. It accurately describes the main components (asparagus, eggs), baking instructions, and the use of cheese for topping. However, there's room for improvement in terms of detail and complexity.  For example, the instruction to 'use your choice of cheese' could benefit from some suggestions for types, perhaps even mentioning different cheese styles (aged vs. fresh). The lack of detailed steps like cooking the asparagus or measuring ingredients could be improved.",1609,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Prompt_Tuning Fine-Tuned,crustless asparagus quiche,1.88,6,"The recipe attempts to create a crustless asparagus quiche, but the instructions are overly simplistic and lack clear steps.

While it captures the essence, it might benefit from more detailed instructions or safety considerations.",517,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Base Model (Untuned),elegant stuffed mushrooms,6.5,6,"The recipe appears to be a straightforward attempt at making stuffed mushrooms.  It is lacking in the elegance aspect due to the excessive use of paprika and repetitive ingredient names. While it captures the essence of the dish, the over-detailed instruction list could make it more difficult for someone to follow. ",1154,gemma2:2b
Qwen-0.5B (prompt_tuning) - Prompt_Tuning Fine-Tuned,elegant stuffed mushrooms,2.15,6,"The recipe attempts to create a basic stuffed mushroom dish.  While it's clear on the ingredients and steps, the language feels somewhat simplistic and lacks some of the elegance one might expect with 'elegant stuffed mushrooms.'
