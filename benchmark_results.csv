Qwen-0.5B (My Recipe LoRA) - Base Model Only,pizza dough,17.91,1,"The recipe is critically flawed as it completely omits yeast or any leavening agent, which is essential for pizza dough. The resulting product would be a dense, hard flatbread or cracker, not pizza. The instructions are also illogical, lacking a proofing step and ending prematurely.",1604
Qwen-0.5B (My Recipe LoRA) - Base Model Only,black currant yogurt ice cream,10.45,2,"The recipe uses appropriate ingredients but fails critically in its methodology. It neglects to process the whole black currants, which will result in an unpleasant texture, and the instructions for freezing are contradictory and technically unsound, conflating chilling, blending, and churning.",1606
Qwen-0.5B (My Recipe LoRA) - Base Model Only,burriquitas mini burrito,13.2,1,"The recipe is critically flawed and unsafe. It instructs the user to mix raw ground beef with other ingredients and bake for a time insufficient to cook it, posing a significant food safety risk. Furthermore, the instructions never actually create a burrito, but rather a baked filling to be served 'with' tortillas, failing the primary goal of the recipe.",1425
