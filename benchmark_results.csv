Qwen-0.5B (My Recipe LoRA) - Base Model Only,pizza dough,20.21,6,"The recipe provides a basic framework for making pizza dough, but it lacks some crucial details and misses certain elements of the culinary process. While it lists standard ingredients and presents clear instructions for kneading, the recipe doesn't provide context about optimal mixing times or how to handle gluten development for better elasticity. The inclusion of a baking temperature is absent from the instructions, which could lead to inconsistent results. This recipe demonstrates potential but requires significant refinement.",1652
Qwen-0.5B (My Recipe LoRA) - Base Model Only,black currant yogurt ice cream,11.66,2,"The recipe attempts to make black currant yogurt ice cream but lacks fundamental culinary understanding. It's more akin to a fruit puree with the added bonus of a very literal freezer-style approach rather than ice cream creation.  There is no true emulsification or churning, which are essential for creating ice cream and a noticeable texture. Instead, it relies on freezing, resulting in something closer to frozen yogurt.",1809
Qwen-0.5B (My Recipe LoRA) - Base Model Only,burriquitas mini burrito,11.65,4,"The recipe attempts to capture the essence of a mini burrito in its structure. However, it lacks clarity in defining what constitutes a 'burriquitas mini burrito.'  Additionally, while some ingredients are common in burritos (beans, cheese), others like corn and diced tomatoes seem out-of-place for this specific dish, making it more ambiguous in execution. It also requires clarification on how to achieve that distinct texture we associate with a Burriquitas Mini Burrito.",1423
